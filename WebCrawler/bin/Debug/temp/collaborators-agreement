            <h2 id="l831">1. Introduction</h2>

            <p>W3C, as an organization, only accepts membership from
            organizations. To be able to work with individual experts in
            W3C Groups, W3C has a system of so called "Invited
            Experts".</p>

            <p>It is common that the Chair or the Team Contact of a
            given W3C Group invite individual Experts to participate in
            the W3C Group in order to improve the resulting
            Specification and in order to allow individuals with
            expertise in specific areas not otherwise available in these
            Groups to participate in W3C work. As W3C is a Member
            organization, there are limits to the number and the type of
            people being invited in order to avoid discouraging W3C
            Membership of organizations. </p>

            <p>Invited Experts are accepted by W3C to work in a specific
            Working Group or Interest Group.
            Sometimes the Group is Member confidential, another Group
            may be open to the public.</p>

            <p>This document establishes the rules and legal conditions
            for invited experts accepted by <acronym title="World Wide
            Web Consortium">W3C</acronym>.  It governs their
            relationship to <acronym title="World Wide Web
            Consortium">W3C</acronym> and their participation in W3C
            Groups. </p>

            <p>Further information about the Invited expert application
            can be found at: </p>

            </ul>
            <h2 id="L83">2. W3C Process </h2>

            <p>W3C develops technical Specifications called <q>Technical
            Reports</q>.  Those <q>Technical Reports</q> are built
            following a predefined Process that is laid down in the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">W3C Process
            Document</a>. The Invited Expert hereby recognizes that his or
            her activities in the <acronym title="World Wide Web
            Consortium">W3C</acronym> are guided and ruled by the then
            current <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">W3C
            Process Document</a>.  Violation of the W3C Process is ground for
            termination of the Invited Expert Agreement by W3C (see <a
            href="#L172">section 5</a>.).</p>
            
            <p>W3C is hosted by <acronym title="Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology">MIT</acronym>, <acronym title="European Research
            Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics">ERCIM</acronym>,
            Keio University and Beihang University. Contractual rights and
            obligations out of this Agreement benefit all four Host
            organizations. Each Host organization of W3C is entitled to
            manage and enforce all rights out of this Agreement.</p>

            <h3 id="L110">2.1 Member Access</h3>

            <p>W3C may, at its discretion, grant Invited Experts access to
            Member confidential information, generally based on the level
            of confidentiality of meeting records and other proceedings
            described in a group charter. This access includes
            mailing-lists, website, tools, teleconferences and meetings.
            W3C seeks to ensure that all Invited Experts in a given W3C
            Group have the access necessary to enable the group to conduct
            its work.</p>

            <p>Invited Experts participating in work open to the public do
            not have access to Member confidential information and have no
            right to require such access unless they are also Invited
            Experts in a W3C Group which operates in W3C Member space.
            They accept that some of their communication may be sent to
            Member confidential mailing lists where they do not have
            access. If, on an exceptional basis, Invited Experts without
            regular access to Member confidential information are invited
            to a Member confidential meeting or participate there by
            accident, they are bound by the Member confidentiality
            obligations like an Invited Expert with regular Member
            access.</p>

            <h3 id="L118">2.2 Copyright</h3>

            <p>Copyright is a very important part of standardization
            activities. It allows the standards development organization
            to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and
            thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.</p>

            <p>In the course of the development of materials within the
            W3C, Invited Experts will make contributions. Those
            contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed
            work thus creating shared copyright on the Invited Expert's
            contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with
            acknowledgement of contributions. </p>

            <p>The Invited Expert hereby grants to the W3C a perpetual,
            nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under
            any Invited Expert's copyrights on his or her contributions,
            to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under 
            a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Invited Expert grants
            a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works
            prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part
            of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of
            this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by
            the W3C. Furthermore, the Invited Expert understands that W3C
            will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of
            Invited Expert's contribution, including enforcement against
            infringers without additional agreement or notice.</p>

            <p>
            Nothing in this agreement restricts the Invited Expert from
            using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have
            later been amalgamated into joint works.
            </p>

            <p>
            Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C
            Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to
            restrict the Invited Expert from exercising the permissions granted by
            that license.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Invited Experts represent that they are legally entitled to
            grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to
            intellectual property that the Invited Expert creates that
            includes the contributions, they represent that they have
            received permission to make contributions on behalf of that
            employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the
            contributions to W3C. </p>

            <h3 id="L131">2.3 Patent Policy</h3>

            <p>The Invited Experts represent that they are legally
            entitled to grant the necessary licenses for their
            contribution as described in the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">Patent
            Policy</a>, especially in <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-invited">Section
            3.4</a> thereof. If the Invited Experts' employer(s) have rights
            to intellectual property that the Invited Experts create that
            includes their contributions, they represent that they have received
            permission to make the relevant licensing commitments according to
            the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#title">W3C
            Patent Policy</a> on behalf of that employer. </p>

            <h3 id="L141">2.4 Decency</h3>

            <p>Invited Expert will participate in the W3C Group in a
            decent way. Invited Experts will refrain from defaming,
            harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The
            Invited Expert agrees to indemnify and hold W3C harmless from
            any dispute which may arise from a breach of terms of this
            Agreement.  The <a
              href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">Section
            3.1 of the Process Document</a> applies. </p>

            <p>The Invited Expert refrains from sending unsolicited
            commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional
            activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is
            especially required from Invited Experts sending messages to
            public W3C Groups. </p>

            <h3 id="L147">2.5 Confidentiality</h3>

            <p>Invited Experts participating in Member-confidential work
            are bound by the Member-confidentiality obligation as
            expressed in the Member agreement as any other Participant
            from a W3C Member organization by the W3C Member
            confidentiality as defined in <a
              href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">Section
              7.2 of the Process Document</a>. Violation of W3C Member
            Confidentiality is deemed a grave violation of this Agreement
            and is ground for termination of the Invited Expert Agreement
            by W3C (see <a href="#L172">section 5</a>.) </p>

            <p>Capabilities are granted to the individual Invited Expert,
            not the organization with which he or she may be affiliated.
            Invited Experts should limit communications relevant to the
            proceeding of Member activities to others bound by the member
            or participant agreements unless a part of their role is
            sharing selected information with the public or external
            communities.</p>

            <h3 id="L156">2.6 Use of Names</h3>

            <p>Neither Invited Experts nor their employers will use the
            name of W3C, MIT, ERCIM or KEIO without prior permission. In
            return W3C, MIT, ERCIM or KEIO will not use the name of the
            Participant in any form of publicity without prior permission.
            This is often determined by the policy of the W3C Group with
            respect to contributions to a deliverable or press release
            attribution.</p>

            <h2 id="L160">3. Participation cost</h2>

            <p>The cost for participation in W3C work, including
            telecommunication costs, travel costs and all other costs
            incurred by the participation in W3C work will reside solely
            with the Invited Expert. On an exceptional basis W3C may grant
            some compensation for travel expenses and/or
            collaboration.</p>

            <h2 id="L164">4. Notifications</h2>
            
            <p>The Invited Expert will notify W3C of any change in
            affiliation and other aspects relevant for this relationship.
            This includes any possible conflicts of interest that might
            arise. Such conflicts may arise from participation in other
            work on standards and consulting relationships in technology
            areas competing with the work the Expert was invited for. <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#coi">Section
            3.1.1 of the W3C Process Document</a> applies. </p>

            <p>Such notifications should be sent to the Team-Contact of the
            W3C Group the Expert is invited to with cc to
            correc@ti.con. </p>
   
            <p>In all notifications and communications, Invited Experts
            will, to the best of their knowledge, convey complete and true
            information. </p>

            <h2 id="L172">5. Duration and Termination</h2>

            <p>The duration of the Invited Expert's participation is
            determined and fixed by W3C, and archived. The Participation
            can be renewed one or more times. At the completion of the
            Invited Expert's term, W3C will terminate the relationship and
            remove all privileges without being obliged to give prior
            notice.</p>
   
            <p>Either party may end the relationship at their discretion.
            The relationship of the parties under this Agreement shall be
            that of a voluntary association. This Agreement does not create
            a partnership or joint venture.  Neither W3C, nor the
            Participant can bind the other or create any relationship of
            principal or agent.</p>

            <p>Invited Experts are subject to the same commitment as any
            other Member of the W3C Group they are invited to. If the
            required commitment is not fulfilled, W3C might close accounts and end
            privileges of any Invited Expert without prior notice. </p>

            <p>Even in the event of termination of the Invited Expert
            relationship sections <a href="#L118">2.2</a>, <a
            href="#L131">2.3</a>, <a href="#L147">2.5</a> and <a
            href="#L156">2.6</a> will persist. </p>

            <h2 id="L182">6. Assignment</h2>

            <p>As the relationship of the Invited Expert with W3C is as an
            individual relationship, all assignments to any third party are
            not permissible.  Assignments in violation of this clause are
            null and void.</p>

            <h2 id="L186">7. Choice of Law</h2>

            <p>This Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws
            of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA. Further, the laws of the
            Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA, will govern any dispute arising
            from the terms of this agreement or a breach of this Agreement.
            The Invited Expert agrees to personal jurisdiction by the state
            and federal courts sitting in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>
