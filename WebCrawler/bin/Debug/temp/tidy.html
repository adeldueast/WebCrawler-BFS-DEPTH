    <p>HTML Tidy is a tool that was originally written by Dave
    Raggett of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/"><img src=
    "../images/world.gif" width="17" height="15" class="bullet"
    alt="[Off Site]" />World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>. It is
    designed to fix mistakes in HTML, tidy up the layout (hence the
    name), assist with web accessibility, convert HTML to XHTML and
    many other things.</p>

    <p>The software is now maintained by a group of volunteers
    working as an <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/"><img src=
    "../images/world.gif" width="17" height="15" class="bullet"
    alt="[Off Site]" />Open Source Community at Source Forge</a>
    and this is the place to go for more information.</p>

    <p>The version down-loadable from this page has been taken from
    a recent &#8216;Beta&#8217; source released by the Source Forge
    volunteers and compiled for Win32 using <a href=
    "http://www.mingw.org/"><img src="../images/world.gif" width=
    "17" height="15" class="bullet" alt="[Off Site]" />MinGW</a>
    (Minimalist GNU for Windows). This produces a very compact
    binary which requires no additional libraries or environment in
    which to run. It is now built from the &#8220;tidylib&#8221;
    sources without the Asian and UTF16 character encodings or the
    Accessibility checks. There are two executables in the ZIP
    file, <code>tidy.exe</code> and <code>tab2space.exe</code>.</p>

    <p>I try to keep my system virus free but you do check
    downloaded files yourself, don&#8217;t you? &lt;g&gt;</p>

    <h3>Install and Uninstall</h3>

    <p>These tools do not require any external libraries or
    environment. Just unzip them to where they are needed,
    preferably a folder which is in the search path.</p>

    <p>Uninstall? Just delete the two files.</p>

    <h3>To run Tidy</h3>

    <p>This is a command line application so you will need a Cmd or
    DOS window. Make sure that the tidy.exe is in a folder
    contained in the search path (defined in
    <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> before Win-XP or in <code>My Computer
    &#8212;&gt; Properties &#8212;&gt; Advanced &#8212;&gt;
    Environment Variables &#8212;&gt; System Variables &#8212;&gt;
    Path</code> for Win-XP). The program is run using the
    command</p>
    <pre class="screen">
C:\&gt;tidy [-switches] file.htm
</pre>

    <p>See the documentation at <a href=
    "http://tidy.sourceforge.net/"><img src="../images/world.gif"
    width="17" height="15" class="bullet" alt="[Off Site]" />Source
    Forge</a> for a full instruction manual.</p>

    <p>I am unable to help with the use of this program and accept
    no liability for any problems with it, however caused. Use at
    your own risk.</p>

    <h3>Build notes</h3>

    <p>To build the tidy system you need the MinGW
    &#8220;composite&#8221; system (I am currently using version
    3.1.0-1) and also the Make component (version 3.80.0-3). Then
    put the binary directory (probably
    <code>C:\MinGW\bin</code>)into the path. To do this (from an
    admin account in Win-XP) select <code>My Computer &#8212;&gt;
    Properties &#8212;&gt; Advanced &#8212;&gt; Environment
    Variables</code> and edit the <code>Path</code> in the
    <code>System Variables</code> section adding
    <code>;C:\MinGW\bin</code> to the end (that is a semi-colon at
    the start).</p>

    <p>There were some minor issues during the build that are worth
    mentioning.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>For some reason there is no alias <code>make</code> or
      <code>gmake</code> in the MinGW directory so the procedure is
      to <code>cd</code> to <code>tidy\build\gmake</code> and issue
      the command <code>mingw32-make</code>.</li>

      <li>
        <p>The make objected to all the lines of the form</p>
        <pre class="screen">
if [ ! -d $(DIR) ]; then mkdir $(DIR); fi
</pre>

        <p>Whether that is something fundamental I have not
        checked, but in the mean time a workaround is to create the
        required directories by hand (<code>bin &amp; lib</code> in
        the root directory, <code>obj</code> in the
        <code>build\gmake</code> directory) and ignore the syntax
        errors. Update&#8212;with version 3.80.0-3 of make from
        MinGW I have had to comment these lines out of the Makefile
        as the syntax errors are fatal.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>MinGW make does not require (in fact objects to) the
        explicit request for the c library ( -lc switch). I
        commented out the line in the Makefile</p>
        <pre class="screen">
# LIBS=-lc
</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>NoteTab Pro</h3>

    <p>To install as a plugin to NoteTab Pro, I use the following
    <code>tidy.cfg</code> file in the NoteTab Pro install folder.
    Some of these are my personal preferences.</p>
    <pre class="screen">
tab-size: 8
indent: auto
enclose-text: yes
wrap-script-literals: no
tidy-mark: yes
doctype: auto
output-xhtml: yes
numeric-entities: yes
quiet: yes
