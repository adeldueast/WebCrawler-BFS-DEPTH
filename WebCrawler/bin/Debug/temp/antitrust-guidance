    <h1>Antitrust and Competition Guidance</h1>

  <p>
<p>W3C is dedicated to the development of technical specifications
and best practices for interoperability. W3C does not play
any role in the competitive decisions of W3C participants nor in any way
restrict competition. W3C's policy is that its activities are
conducted to the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all
applicable antitrust and competition laws and
regulations. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process">W3C
Process</a> is designed to support open and fair deliberations leading
to consensus-based decisions and to assure that Web standards produced
by that Process can be implemented on a royalty-free basis. </p>

<p>Participants develop competing technologies, products,
and services. Participants must ensure that their conduct does not
violate antitrust and competition laws and regulations. For example,
participants should not discuss product pricing, methods or channels
of product distribution, division of markets, allocation of customers,
or any other topic that should not be discussed among competitors. It
is each participantâ€™s responsibility to obtain appropriate legal
counsel regarding their conduct in W3C and to comply with applicable
antitrust or competition laws and regulations.</p>
