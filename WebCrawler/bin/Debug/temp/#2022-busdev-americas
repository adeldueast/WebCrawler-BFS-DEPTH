<h3 id="2021-automotive-champion">Automotive &amp; Transportation Champion</h3>
<p>The World Wide Web Consortium has opened a position (possibly part-time) to hire a global leader focusing on applying open web technologies to the automotive &amp; transportation ecosystem.</p>
<p>In the era of the “connected car” there has been a proliferation of networking technology to support vehicle communications. This includes in-vehicle, vehicle-to-cloud, and vehicle-smart-cities infrastructure. Usage includes internal measurements, connections to remote services, infotainment, collision avoidance, and leveraging smart city applications. The scope of this position is not restricted to automotive, but also considers related enhancements required in a broader transportation ecosystem. As the convener for open web technology standards, W3C has several efforts to apply web technologies to these applications and create unique extensions required for automotive.</p>
<p>The Automotive &amp; Transportation Champion drives the overall strategy of applying open web standards to the automotive sector. The Champion is a thought leader who has a deep understanding of the needs of the automotive industry and a working understanding of web technology. The Champion engages with other automotive thought leaders from W3C Members and with technologists in W3C. By bringing these groups together, the Champion identifies new technology needs for the industry and identifies technical and business approaches to satisfy those needs.</p>
<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
<p>The successful candidate will develop strategies to improve automotive technologies, propose new charters within W3C to frame that work, persuade the W3C community that these technologies help both the automotive sector as well as the Web at large, and provide technical guidance to resulting groups on how to achieve new web standards for automotive. The successful candidate will engage with thought leaders at W3C Member companies who work in auto-tech to jointly develop a vision of how web technologies can solve problems for the industry. The successful candidate will work with people in W3C Business Development on outreach to the broader ecosystem of automotive industry organizations who would benefit from this work. The successful candidate will be a frequent lecturer at Automotive and Smart Cities conferences who could add descriptions of this work to those presentations.</p>
<p>This effort both addresses auto-tech functional needs, but also ties these needs together with key web imperatives – including accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security.</p>
<p>The work will be directed by the W3C Industry Lead, and the Champion will work closely with other functions at W3C; particularly Project Management, Strategy, and Business Development.</p>
<p>The Champion will also work with staff that develops technologies in companion areas, such as: Smart Cities, Web of Things, and Vocabularies.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<ul class="show_items">
<li>Working knowledge of the open web technologies stack from W3C.</li>
<li>Extensive knowledge of automotive technology.</li>
<li>Long-term contacts within both the executive and technical leaders in the automotive industry.</li>
<li>A track record of creating impactful strategies.</li>
<li>A track record of building teams and collaboration.</li>
<li>Experience in project management.</li>
<li>At least a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent in a relevant field of study.  (An MBA or equivalent business experience is highly desired.)</li>
<li>Excellent oral and written communications skills in English.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Beneficial skills and experience</h4>
<ul class="show_items">
  <li>The Automotive &amp; Transportation Champion should be familiar with the work in key auto industry consortia. Some examples are:
    <ul class="show_items">
      <li>The Connected Car Consortium (digital keys)</li>
      <li>SAE (lower level in-vehicle protocols)</li>
      <li>COVESA (formerly GENIVI) (complementary standards, specifically CVII)</li>
      <li>AutoSAR (lower level in-vehicle protocols)</li>
      <li>ISO Extended Vehicle/Neutral Server</li>
      <li>ISO Smart Cities</li>
      <li>ISO ITS</li>
      <li>Automotive Grade Linux</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Experience in engaging in standardization bodies</li>
  <li>Experience in dealing with regulation aspects of auto tech</li>
  <li>Robust experience in the automotive industry</li>
  <li>Ability to negotiate proposals and to build trust and consensus among different stakeholder groups</li>
  <li>Proficiency in one or more languages other than English.</li>
</ul>
