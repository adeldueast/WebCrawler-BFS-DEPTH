<p><em></em></p>

<p>The Wednesday of the Technical Plenary Week offers a unique opportunity
for Working, Interest and Coordination Group participants who have registered
to gather in one room and discuss technical topics of broad interest to the
attendees, and of significant importance to past, present and future of the
World Wide Web Consortium. Discussion during this Technical Plenary day will
not be considered Member confidential. Slides will be publicly accessible.</p>

        Welcome</strong>

        <p><em>Description</em>: Two unique features of the World Wide Web
        Consortium are its broad spectrum of foundational work, coupled with
        its strong emphasis on coordination across and outside of that
        spectrum. The Technical Plenary week is a unique occasion when the
        people responsible for the work and coordination facilitate their
        objectives face-to-face. This session provides a brief overview of
        the W3C's spectrum of near-past, present and near-future work, with
        the hope that you will better understand (and be inspired by) the
        spectrum and significance of: (a) our recent accomplishments, (b) our
        future work, (c) cross-group cooperation and review, and (d)
        subsequent sessions of the Tech Plenary.</p>

        Extensibility and Versioning</strong>

        <p><em>Description:</em> The Technical Architecture Group is
        considering a number of issues related to extensibility and
        versioning of XML languages (<a
        href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html?type=1#XMLVersioning-41">XML
        Versioning-41</a>). They are considering strategies for constructing
        languages that can change in a backwards- and forwards-compatible
        way, as well as constraints and good practices for using XML, XML
        Namespaces, and W3C XML Schema in language construction and
        extension. The TAG has had a continuing <a
        href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2005JanMar/0002.html">dialog</a>
        on this topic with stakeholder Working Groups. This session provides
        and open forum for discussion of these issues, led by a panel of
        representatives from some of the stakeholders and the TAG.</p>

        <p><em>Description</em>: There are several efforts to move XML to
        solve new problem areas. A less charitable way would be to say that
        XML is being pulled in many directions. In this interactive panel
        we'll have several key participants and luminaries talk about where
        XML is going, where it should go, and perhaps where it shouldn't.

        <p><em>Description</em>: As W3C specifications become more
        modularized there is a growing number of dependencies between W3C
        specifications. This panel session will demonstrate and discuss the
        issues of building test suites that include the requirements of

        <p><strong>Discussion Topic: Joint Tests Suite
        Development</strong></p>

        <p><em>Description</em>: The purpose of the lunch discussion is to
        explore the importance and the resources needed for the development
        of joint test suites. During lunch people will be asked to introduce
        themselves, state which working groups they participate in, the
        dependencies of their specification on other specifications,
        summarize their group's development of test suites and how test
        suites have facilitated the implementation of their specifications.
        After the introductions people will be asked to discuss the following
        questions related to joint test suite development.</p>

        <p></p>
        <ol>
          <li>What are the features needed in joint test suites for your
            specification?</li>
          <li>What are the resources and coordination that would facilitate
            development of joint test suites?</li>
          <li>What is the importance of joint test suites in insuring
            interoperability?</li>
        </ol>

        <p></p>

        <p>At least one person from each table needs to fill out a short form
        summarizing the table discussion. The results will be presented
        during the Lightning Talks session.</p>

        <p><em>Description</em>: With the ubiquity of Web browsers and Web
        document formats across a range of platforms and devices, many
        developers are using the Web as a platform-independent application
        environment. In this session we'll look at some of the results of
        last year's W3C Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents,

        W3C Web Space</strong>

        <p><em>Description</em>: Usability tests (observing real people
        completing real tasks) on the WAI site revealed just how lost people
        can get on the W3C Web site. Because of the huge impact of the site
        on our meeting our goals, we recently redesigned the WAI sub-site. In
        this session we will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Demonstrate the importance and power of effective Web design in
            promoting specifications, encouraging implementations, and
            increasing the efficiency of Working Groups and Team members.</li>
          <li>Overview the user-centered design process that WAI used to
            redesign the sub-site.</li>
          <li>Present the final prototype of the redesigned site.</li>
          <li>Introduce what Working Groups can do with limited time and
            effort to increase the effectiveness of their W3C Web pages.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This lively, interactive session includes audience participation
        (bring your laptop with wireless network connection), demos,
        quantitative and qualitative results of before and after usability
        testing, and enlightening video clips.</p>

        access the Web through a mouse, touchscreens, pens, voice, gestures,
        and assistive technologies. These technologies are increasingly being
        developed using W3C standards, including voice and multimodal
        standards, and are being deployed both in clients and in the network,
        especially for mobile applications. This session will feature several
        demonstrations to give you an insight into the latest advancements in
        these areas.</p>
