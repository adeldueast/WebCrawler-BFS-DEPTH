<h1>HTML Working Group IPR disclosures</h1>

<p class="note"><strong>Note.</strong>
The HTML Working Group was <a href="/2002/05/html/charter">rechartered</a>
in August 2002. Please refer to the <a href="/MarkUp/2002/Disclosures"
>Patent Disclosures page for the rechartered HTML Working Group</a>.</p>
    
<p>The following statements are the patent disclosures and license
commitments associated with the deliverables of
the <a href="/MarkUp/Group/">HTML Working Group</a>
(<em><a href="http://cgi.w3.org/MemberAccess/">members only</a></em>)
provided by Working Group members as suggested by
the <a href="/TR/2002/NOTE-patent-practice-20020124#sec-Disclosure">W3C
Current Patent Practice</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> does not take a position
regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property right
or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation
or use of the technology, nor the extent to which any license under
such rights might or might not be available. Copyright of WG deliverables
is vested in the W3C.</p>

<p>Per the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010719">19
July 2001 Process Document</a>,</p>

<blockquote
   cite="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010719/policies.html#ipr">
<p>To disclose patent and IPR claims, individuals must send email
to <a href="mailto:correc@ti.con">correc@ti.con</a>,
which is an archived mailing list readable by Members and the Team.</p>
</blockquote>
    
<p>Therefore, when a Member explicitly agrees to have its patent disclosure
and IPR claims made public, they are included in this document.</p>
    
<p><em>Note:</em> Members of the Working Group are expected to disclose
any intellectual property they have in the area. This WG works on
a royalty-free basis. The Working Group is thus obliged to produce
a specification which relies only on intellectual property available
on a royalty-free basis.</p>

<hr />

<p>As of August 2002, the HTML Working Group participants and the W3C are not
aware of any patents that are essential to implement the deliverables
of the HTML Working Group, described in
the <a href="/MarkUp/2000/Charter">HTML Working Group Charter</a>.</p>
