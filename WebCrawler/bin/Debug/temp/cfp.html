<h1 align="center">Workshop on W3C's Multimodal Architecture and
  Interfaces</h1>

<h3 align="center">16-17 November 2007</h3>

<h3 align="center">Hosted by

<h2><a name="background" id="background">Background</a></h2>

<p>
<!-- MMI-WG -->
The W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/mmi/">Multimodal Interaction
Working Group</a> seeks to extend the Web to allow
users to dynamically select the most appropriate modes of interaction
for their current needs,
including (a) needs of the specific users (e.g., users with
disabilities) (b) across interactions (e.g., use keyboard instead of
speech in a noisy environment) and (c) within interactions (e.g.,
speak a command and point to select the object of the command).
Multimodal modes of input are especially important for hand-held
portable devices with small displays and small or nonexistent keypads.
</p>

<p>
<!-- MMI Architecture -->
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/"> Multimodal Architecture
and Interfaces (MMI Architecture) </a> specification is designed to
provide a general and flexible framework providing interoperability
among modality-specific components from different vendors - for
example, speech recognition from one vendor and handwriting
recognition from another.

This framework places very few restrictions on the individual
components or on their interactions with each other, but instead
focuses on providing a general means for allowing them to communicate
with each other, plus basic infrastructure for application control and
platform services.
</p>

<!-- What to improve -->
<p>
The approach allows simple multimodal capabilities to be added to
existing markup languages in a way that is backwards compatible with
widely deployed mobile devices, and which builds upon widespread
familiarity with existing Web technologies.

The standards should be scalable to
enable richer capabilities on subsequent generations of multimodal
devices.

This involves the separation of the user interface from the
application, to enable different user interfaces according to the
user's preferences and the capabilities available to the devices.
</p>

<p>
In order to make the MMI Architecture more useful in current and emerging
markets, the Multimodal Interaction Working Group is interested in
suggestions on how to improve the use of the architecture to support
and integrate various user interfaces on multimodal devices
e.g. speech, GUI and Ink.
</p>

<h2><a name="goals" id="goals">Workshop Goals</a></h2>

<p>
Identify and prioritize requirements for changes, extensions and
additions to the MMI Architecture to better support speech, GUI, Ink
and other Modality Components.
</p>

<p>
Attendees SHOULD be familiar with 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/">
the MMI Architecture
</a>.

The main focus of the workshop is requirements for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#Interfaces">
the interfaces
</a>
between
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#N10152">
the Runtime Framework</a>
and
various
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#N10191">
Modality Components
</a>
(e.g., voice, pen, ink, etc.) within the MMI Architecture.

Specifically, we ask the participants (browser vendors, device
vendors, application vendors, etc.) to clarify:
</p>
<ul>
<li>How to integrate specific modality components e.g ink and voice into the MMI
    Architecture?</li>
<li>What are the limitations of the MMI Architecture?</li>
<li>What should be done in the MMI Architecture to enable applications
  to adapt to different modality combinations?</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="deliverables" id="deliverables">Deliverables</a></h2>

<p>
The workshop will produce a document identifying and prioritizing
requirements for extensions and additions to the MMI Architecture that
will improve the use of the architecture to better support speech, GUI
and Ink interfaces on multimodal devices.

The W3C Multimodal Interaction Group will use this document
as a guideline for future enhancements to the MMI Architecture.
</p>

<h2><a name="scope" id="scope">Scope of the Workshop</a></h2>

<p>
The scope of this workshop is restricted in order to make the best use
of participants' time.

In general, discussion at the workshop and in the position papers
should stay focused on the workshop goal: identify and prioritize
requirements for extensions and additions to the MMI Architecture that
will improve the use of the MMI Architecture to better support speech, GUI
and Ink interfaces on multimodal devices.

Descriptions of new requirements with usage scenarios and clear
explanations of the problems to be solved is of top priority for the
workshop, while examples of the MMI Architecture syntax extensions is
secondary priority.
</p>


<h2><a name="expected_audience" id="expected_audience">Expected Audience</a></h2>

<p>We expect several communities to contribute to the workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multimodal portable hand-held device vendors</li>
<li>Web browser vendors</li>
<li>Developers of applications using multimodal interfaces</li>
<li>Multimodal Interaction experts</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="requirements_for_participants" id="requirements_for_participants">Requirements for Participation</a></h2>

<p><strong>Position papers are required</strong> to participate in
this workshop. Each organization or individual wishing to

Participation is pending acceptance of the position paper by the
program committee.</p>

<h3>Topics</h3>

<li>Extensions to the InkML needed to work within a multimodal
environment.</li>

<li>How to process early and late information fusion.</li>

<li>How to dynamically select appropriate modalities.</li>

<li>Plans to support multimodal applications and what standards are
needed.</li>

<li>What kind of other W3C specification should be considered to
provide user interface skins for whichever modes of interaction
selected.</li>

<li>
Support for effective user interfaces for various modes of
interaction, in terms of contextual prompts, constrained text input,
and declarative event handlers, taking account of uncertainties in
user input.
</li>

<li>
Re-use of existing markup languages for prompts and constraints
