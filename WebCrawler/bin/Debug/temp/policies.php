      <h2>Policies - Fall 2018</h2>
    </div>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>In CS 240 we assume that you have previously taken
introductory programming courses in which you learned the basic concepts of
object-oriented programming, and that you have previously taken an introductory
data structures and algorithms course where you learned about linked lists,
binary search trees, hashing, sorting, etc. At BYU-Provo these requirements are
    filled by successfully completing CS 142 and CS 235. It is recommended that 
    you also complete CS 236 before taking CS 240.  Exceptionally well-prepared
    students may take CS 240 before CS 236, depending on their level of
    programming maturity.</p>
<h3>Course Objectives</h3><p>The goal of CS 240 is to help students learn a variety
of computer programming concepts and skills that are essential in developing realistic
software systems. Specifically, the objectives of the course are to: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Have experience in and be comfortable with programming large programs
	<li>Be able to apply problem solving techniques to large programs
		<ul>
		<li>Be familiar with basic object-oriented design concepts
		<li>Know and understand basic coding, testing, and debugging strategies for large programs
		</ul>
	<li>Learn the Java programming language
	<li>Learn the fundamental concepts and implementation techniques of:
		<ul>
		<li>Relational databases
		<li>Graphical user interfaces
		<li>Mobile programming
		<li>Web APIs
		</ul>
	<li>Demonstrate the aptitude and work ethic necessary to succeed in computer science
</ol>

    <h3>Class Attendance</h3><p>You are accountable for all material presented in
    class. Class attendance is a prerequisite for receiving help from
	TAs on the programming projects. 
	Class is the primary forum for conducting administrative
    business (changes to assignments, due dates, exam dates, etc.).
    You are accountable for all administrative information
    presented in class. If you miss class, you need to find out
    what announcements were made in your absence.</p>

    <p>The <a href="schedule.php">class schedule</a> provides
    information about the lecture topics that are planned for each
    day. We will try to strictly follow this schedule, but
    unforeseen events may require some changes.</p>

    <h3>Technology Use in Class</h3>
    <p>
	We have learned by sad experience that technology is a major distraction to students in class,
	and prevents them from listening, participating, and learning as they should.
	Therefore, you may not use laptops, tablets, phones, or other technology in class.
	Notes may be taken using good old-fashioned paper and pen(cil).
	If you have disability that requires use of an electronic device in class, speak with your
	instructor.
    </p>

    <h3>Textbooks</h3>

    <p>There are two textbooks for the course, both of which are
    required and available at the BYU Bookstore and various online retailers,
    such as Amazon.com.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Core Java SE 9 for the Impatient, 2nd Edition by Cay Horstmann</i></li>

      <li><i>Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (3rd Edition) by Bill Phillips, et. al.</i></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many lectures have associated reading assignments from the
    textbooks. Reading assignments should be completed
    <u>before</u> coming to class. If you don't do the reading
    before coming to class, you may have difficulty following the
    lecture. You will be held accountable for all material covered
    in the reading assignments, including material that is not
    covered in class. Please refer to the <a href=
    "schedule.php">class schedule</a> for specific information on
    the reading assignments.</p>
<!--    
    <h3>Android Device</h3>
    In addition to the required textbooks, a few weeks into the course, you will also be 
    required to have an Android hardware device on which to complete your programming 
    projects. Your device must be running Android 4.4, API level 19, or later.
    If you wish to use the BYU CS open lab computers to do your Android
    programming projects, you will need to acquire an Amazon Kindle Fire 
    Tablet device (Fire OS 4, API level 19, or later), as these are the only
    Android devices that the BYU CS open lab computers are configured to 
    work with.  (For more details on Kindle Fire Tablet devices, click 
    <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tablets/specifications/01-device-and-feature-specifications">here</a>)
    Thus, the Kindle Fire Tablet is the official device for the course, and 
    the only device teaching assistants will be able to help you with.
    You are free to use other Android devices, but you will be more on your 
    own with those.
    Kindle Fire Tablets are available on the amazon.com web site for about 
    $99, although they are often on sale for less.
    If you wish, you may buy Kindle versions of the course textbooks, 
    and put them on your Android device.
-->
    <h3>Computers and Accounts</h3>

    <p>All programming for this class is done on the Linux
    operating system. The Computer Science Dept. provides computers
    that you may use for your programming assignments. The Linux
    computer labs are located on the first floor and in the
    basement of the Talmage Building. You will need a Computer
    Science Dept. computer account in order to access these
    machines. (This account is different than your Route-Y
    account.) If you do not already have a Computer Science Dept.
    account, go to the web page at the following link to create or
    enable your account.</p>

    <p>Your CS computer account can be set up here: <a href="https://accounts.cs.byu.edu/">accounts.cs.byu.edu</a><br/>
	Account setup instructions are here: <a href="https://docs.cs.byu.edu/doku.php?id=setting-up-your-account-with-the-cs-authentication-system">Setting Up Your Account</a>
</p>

    <p>Abuse of BYU computers, networks, or facilities involving
    either pornography or illegal activity will result in loss of
    all Computer Science accounts and removal from all CS classes.
    Please refer to the <a href=
    "https://docs.cs.byu.edu/doku.php?id=account-policies-lab-rules">CS Dept.
    Lab Rules and Policies</a> for information regarding
    appropriate lab, computer, and account use.
	If you prefer, you can watch this entertaining video to learn about our lab policies:
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisrJqzAWOc">Lab Policies Video</a>
	You will be held accountable for understanding and abiding by these
    policies.</p>
	
	<p>If you would like to access the CS Dept. computers remotely, you can find instructions
	for doing so here:  <a href="https://docs.cs.byu.edu/doku.php?id=vpn-configuration-and-use">Remote VPN Access</a>
	</p>

    <h3>Programming Exam Problems</h3>

    <p>At the beginning of the course, you will do several relatively
    small programming projects. These programs are designed to help
    you gain experience with Java and the Linux programming
    environment, and to prepare you for the Programming Exam. In
    fact, they are the same programs that you will be required to
    implement when you take the Programming Exam. The only way to
    pass the Programming Exam is to implement these programs before
    taking the exam. Each program should be completed and passed
    off with a TA on or before the due date (see the <a href=
    "schedule.php">class schedule</a> for due dates).</p>

    <p>Although these programs may be passed off after their due
    dates, you should consider yourself behind in the class if you
    are not completing the programs on time. With the pressures of
    your other classes, you may be tempted to get behind in CS240
    with the intent to "catch up" later. Experience has shown that
    you are very unlikely to "catch up" if you get behind, so don't
    let it happen. Discipline yourself and stay on schedule. The
    surest way to fail CS240 is to get behind.</p>

    <h3>Programming Exam</h3>

    <p>One of the major goals of CS 240 is to ensure that all
    students have sufficiently strong programming skills to succeed
    in upper division computer science courses. One mechanism for
    ensuring this is the Programming Exam.</p>

    <p>The exam is taken in one of the CS Dept. Linux labs and
    administered by a TA. You will be randomly assigned one of the
    Programming Exam problems and given three hours to implement a
    solution to the problem. In order to pass the exam, you must
    completely finish the program and pass it off to the TA within
    the time limit.</p>

    <p>There is no partial credit on the Programming Exam; you
    either finish, or you don't. 
      You may bring one sheet of notes to the exam, but your notes may not be project-specific
      (i.e., they may not contain any source code, pseudo-code, or design diagrams
      that are specific to the exam projects).
    The computer used to take the exam will be
    disconnected from the network, thus removing any temptation to
    access a previously implemented solution to the problem.</p>

    <p><b>You must pass the Programming Exam in order to pass
    CS240.</b> The key to passing the exam is to implement each of
    the programs ahead of time. Please note that if you do not
    implement the programs beforehand, it is highly unlikely that
    you will pass the exam. Because passing the Programming Exam is
    required to pass the class, you may take the exam multiple
    times until you pass it (see the <a href="schedule.php">class
    schedule</a> for exam dates). However, your maximum score for
    the exam will go down each time you retake it.</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Attempt</th>

          <th>Maximum Score</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>1</td>

          <td>100%</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>2</td>

          <td>66%</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>3</td>

          <td>33%</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>4, 5, ...</td>

          <td>0%</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><b>If you fail the exam twice, you should meet with your
    instructor to discuss your situation.</b> You will only be
    allowed to take the exam a third time if you have passed off
    all of the exam problems with the TAs.</p>

	<h3>Exams</h3>
	In addition to the Programming Exam, there will be 
	a comprehensive, written Final Exam.  The Final Exam will be given in class at the
	time specified in the university class schedule. (See the <a href=
    "schedule.php">class schedule</a> for exam dates and
    times.)

    <h3>Large Projects</h3>

    <p>A major goal of CS 240 is to ensure that all students are
    able to design, implement, test, and debug large programs. To
    this end, there are two large programming projects in CS 240
    (Family Map Server and Family Map Client). Both of these projects are large
    and require several weeks of consistent effort to complete.
    There are multiple deliverables for each project, the due dates
    for which are listed in the <a href="schedule.php">class
    schedule</a>.</p>

	<p>One of the deliverables for Family Map Server is the Design assignment.  
	The grading policy for this is as follows: 100% is given for perfect or near perfect
 	submissions that meet the requirements of the assignment.
 	50% is given for submissions that need a few changes made, and where clear effort is 
	made to meet the requirements of the assignment.  Assignments given a 50% can be 
	re-submitted with the required changes made for a grade change to 100%. 0% is given when it is clear 
	that little or no effort was made to fulfill the requirements of the assignment by the due date.  
	These submissions will be treated as if nothing was submitted.  The late policy will apply 
	for any re-submission of a design graded as a 0.</p>

    <p>Since the Family Map Client project builds on the Family Map Server project,
	the Family Map Server project must be fully completed before passing it off.
	However, it may be passed off late with a penalty.
	Since it comes at the end of the course, the Family Map Client project may be 
	passed off for partial credit (see the grading rubric for details), but
	it may not be passed off late.</p>

    <p>In addition to getting your code to "work", a significant
    part of your project grade will be based on the quality of your
    work.
	Your code and automated test cases will be graded by a TA based 
	on how well you have followed the good coding and testing practices discussed
	in class. 
	Please note that the TA will evaluate the version of the code you pass off with.
	Therefore, it is in your best interest to tidy up your code and test cases as you go 
	along. </p>

    <h3>Program Pass-Offs</h3>

    <p>All programs must be passed off with a TA in the Linux labs
    during the regularly scheduled TA hours.
    We do not do timestamp-based pass offs. </p>
    
    <p>Additionally, students will have up to 5 passoff attempts for the Server before points will be deducted.
    After your 5th failed passoff attempt you will lose 1% per attempt from your FMS Program grade.
</p>

    <div id="workingTogether">
    <h3>Working Together</h3>

    <p>All assignments that you turn in must be
    your own work. You may discuss concepts, ideas, and general
    approaches with others (e.g. at a whiteboard), but when it
    comes time to create actual design documentation or source code,
    you must work alone. You may not share electronic files or
    hard-copy printouts containing designs or source code with
    other students, either as giver or receiver. You may not work
    in close synchronization with other students in a side-by-side
    fashion. Violations of this policy will result in all involved
    students failing the course and the possibility of further
    action at the university level.</p>
    </div>
	
	<h3>CS 240 Flag</h3>
	<p>
	In order to register for CS classes beyond CS 240, the "CS 240 flag"
	must be set in your student record (this is enforced by the BYU class
	registration system).
	</p>
	<p>
	For CS majors, you must meet with Makenna Johnson in the CS Dept. office to 
	get your CS 240 flag set.
	When you meet with her, Makenna will give you some important information about 
	the CS major.
	A meeting time with Makenna can be arranged by contacting her at correc@ti.con.
	</p>
	<p>
	For non-CS majors, your CS 240 flag will be set automatically after the 
	add/drop deadline.
	You do not need to meet with Makenna.
	</p>

<!--
    <h3>Department Interview for CS Majors (This only applies to CS majors)</h3>

    <p>The CS department uses the semester of 240 in a student's
    course time line to hold department interviews with those who
    are CS majors. In order to register for 300 and 400 level
    classes, CS majors will need to come in
    for a short interview where we can give you career
    and program advisement, let you know about department
    resources, and get feedback and information from you that will
    be valuable for improving our program to better meet your
    needs. The interview will NOT be calculated in your CS 240 grade.
    Majors may have their interviews at any time during the semester
    after they have: 1) Passed the Programming Exam and 2) Completed the
    Family Map Server project with a grade of 70 or higher.  (Students scoring lower than
    70 on Family Map Server must pass the entire class before being allowed to
    register for 300 and 400 level CS classes.)
    Interviews are conducted by Kimberly Jenkins in the CS Department Office (3361 TMCB).
    You can email her to make an appointment at
    <a href="mailto:correc@ti.con">correc@ti.con</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Non-Majors and Registration for 300 and 400 Level CS Classes (This only applies to non-CS majors)</h3>

    <p>In order to be allowed to register for 300 and 400 level CS classes, non-majors must have:
     1) Passed the Programming Exam and 2) Completed the Family Map Server project with a grade of 70 or higher.  
     (Students scoring lower than 70 on Family Map Server must pass the entire class before being allowed to
     register for 300 and 400 level CS classes.)  Once you have completed these requirements, contact
     Kimberly Jenkins in the CS Department Office (3361 TMCB).
     She will set a flag in your student record that will allow you to register for
     300 and 400 level CS classes.
     You can email her at <a href="mailto:correc@ti.con">correc@ti.con</a>.

	<h3>CS Dept. Retake Policy</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Students are allowed only one retake of any class. 
			If a student withdraws from or fails a class a second time, 
			the student will not be allowed to register for any CS course 
			for one semester (or one term, if in spring or summer). 
			This policy does not apply to classes dropped before the add/drop deadline.
			</li>
			<li>
			After one semester (or term), a student must petition to be 
			allowed to take CS courses again.
			The petition must provide evidence of a substantive change that 
			makes success in future CS classes much more likely.
			For example, a student may have demonstrated success in technology,
			math, or science-based courses.
			The petition will be reviewed by the undergraduate advisor.
			</li>
			<li>
			Petitions for non-academic (e.g., medical or military) exceptions 
			to the one semester/term waiting period may be granted according 
			to university policies. 
			Information about filing a petition can be found here:
			<a href="https://cs.byu.edu/retake-policy">CS Dept. Retake Policy</a>

    <h3>Honor Code Standards</h3>

    <p>In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code,
    students are expected to be honest in all of their academic
    work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work
    you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not
    that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a
    failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action
    by the university.</p>

    <p>Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and
    Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself
    and others and ensures an effective learning and working
    environment. It is the university's expectation, and my own
    expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor
    Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847
    if you have questions about those standards.</p>

    <h3>Harassment</h3>

    <p>Harassment of any kind is inappropriate at BYU.
    Specifically, BYU's policy against sexual harassment extends
    not only to employees of the university but to students as
    well. If you encounter sexual harassment, gender-based
    discrimination, or other inappropriate behavior, please talk to
    your professor, contact the Equal Employment Office at 422-5895
    or 367-5689, or contact the Honor Code Office at 422-2847.</p>

    <h3>Disabilities</h3>

    <p>BYU is committed to providing reasonable accommodation to
    qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability
    that may adversely affect your success in this course, please
    contact the University Accessibility Center at 422-2767.
    Services deemed appropriate will be coordinated with the
    student and instructor by that office.</p>

    <h3>Children in the Classroom</h3>

    <p>The serious study of the physical and mathematical sciences
    requires uninterrupted concentration and focus in the
    classroom. Having small children in class is often a
    distraction that degrades the educational experience for the
    entire class. Please make other arrangements for child care
    rather than bringing children to class with you. If there are
    extenuating circumstances, please talk with your instructor in
    advance.</p>
