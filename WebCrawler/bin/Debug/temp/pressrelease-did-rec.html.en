    <hr>
    <p id="desc"><a href="/">https://www.w3.org/</a> &#8212; 19 July 2022 &#8212; The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has announced that Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 is now an official Web standard. This new type of verifiable identifier, which does not require a centralized registry, will enable both individuals and organizations to take greater control of their online information and relationships while also providing greater security and privacy.</p>
    <p>There is a historical analog to this announcement in the evolution of mobile phone numbers. Originally these were owned by the mobile carrier and &quot;rented&quot; to the individual. This required individuals to change numbers if they changed carriers. With the adoption of mobile phone number portability, individuals could now &quot;take their numbers with them&quot; when switching carriers.</p>
    <p>The same is true of most email addresses and social network addresses today—they are not “owned” by individuals and must be changed if the individual changes providers. By contrast, W3C Decentralized Identifiers can be controlled by the individuals or organizations that create them, are portable between service providers, and can last for as long as their controller wants to continue using them.</p>
    <p>Whatsmore, DIDs have the unique property of enabling the controller to verify ownership of the DID using cryptography. This can enable any controller of a DID—an individual, an organization, an online community, a government, an IoT device—to engage in more trustworthy transactions online. For individuals in particular, DIDs can put them back in control of their personal data and consent, and also enable more respectful bi-directional trust relationships where forgery is prevented, privacy is honored, and usability is enhanced.</p>
    <p>Fundamentally, Decentralized Identifiers are a new type of globally unambiguous identifier that can be used to identify any subject (e.g., a person, an organization, a device, a product, a location, even an abstract entity or a concept). Each DID resolves to a DID document that contains the cryptographic material and other metadata for controlling the DID. The foundational pillars of the DID specification are: 1) DIDs do not require a central issuing agency (decentralized), 2) DIDs do not require the continued operation of an underlying organization (persistent), 3) Control of DIDs, and the information they are associated with, can be proven cryptographically (verifiable), and 4) DID metadata can be discovered (resolvable).</p>
    <h3>Markets adopting DIDs</h3>
    <p>W3C Decentralized Identifiers, coupled with W3C Verifiable Credentials, are being used across a number of markets where identification and data authenticity is a concern:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Governments – The US, Canada, and the EU, are exploring the use of DIDs to provide privacy-protecting digital identity documentation for their businesses and residents, which enable those entities to choose how and when their data is shared.</li>
      <li>Retailers – convenience stores, grocery stores, restaurants, bars, and consumer goods companies in the US are utilizing DIDs for new digital age verification programs to increase privacy, checkout speed, and combat the use of fraudulent identity documents when purchasing age-gated products.</li>
      <li>Supply chain stakeholders — global government regulators, trade standards institutions, vendors, shippers, and retailers—are using DIDs to explore next generation systems that more accurately verify the origin and destination of products and services, which will streamline and enable the reporting designed to apply correct tariffs, prevent dumping, and monitor transshipment.</li>
      <li>Workforce – universities, job training programs, and education standards organizations are adopting DIDs in order to issue digital learning credentials that are controlled and shared by the graduate when applying for higher education or workforce positions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Work Continues at W3C</h3>
    <p>W3C, composed of over 450 organizations, has made the investment in W3C Decentralized Identifiers and W3C Verifiable Credentials to ensure a more decentralized, privacy-respecting, and consent-based data sharing ecosystem. Official standards work will continue on these technologies through the newly re-chartered W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0 Working Group, which will focus on expanding functionality based on market feedback. Further incubation on future privacy-respecting technologies will occur through the W3C Credentials Community Group, which is open to participation by the general public.</p>
    
    <h2>About the World Wide Web Consortium</h2>

    <p>The mission of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is to lead
    the Web to its full potential by creating technical standards and
    guidelines to ensure that the Web remains open, accessible, and
    interoperable for everyone around the globe. W3C well-known

All of our products support W3C Verifiable Credentials and W3C Decentralized Identifiers and help reassure our customers that they are investing in a broad, competitive ecosystem of software vendors that all support these interoperable Web standards. <br>
	<br>
	From an individual's perspective, DIDs enable a simpler, safer way to store, share, update, and verify personal data using privacy-respecting identifiers under their personal control. From an enterprise perspective, decentralized technology has the potential to reverse the trends of data breaches and data theft. Companies will no longer need to spend a fortune in the expensive collection–and protection–of data that can quickly become out-of-date, incomplete, or inaccurate. Furthermore, organizations can know with greater certainty that they are interacting with an individual that has the right to use the data they are sharing rather than receiving it from a thief or illicit data broker.<br>
	<br>
	We applaud the newest global standard at the World Wide Web Consortium and look forward to new work at W3C that will enhance and further standardize consent-based data sharing standards that respect individual right to privacy.&quot;</p>

	DID provides a framework to unify and consolidate multiple evolving identity systems. Consolidating identity systems within a single framework is useful for validating the authenticity of information and preserving its integrity as it is moved and processed among cloud, edge, and client systems. This potentially increases the capabilities of the Web to connect and unify multiple sources of information.<br>
	<br>
	The continuing evolution of this work will be key to the development of new technologies in the fields of supply chain management and Internet of Things (IoT) devices and services. For example, a Birds of a Feather (BOF) discussion group at IETF <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-birkholz-supply-chain-integrity-transparency-and-trust-scitt/">Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust (SCITT)</a> has already highlighted DID as a useful approach in providing much needed structure for exchanging information through the supply chain, and the Web of Things (WoT) WG is planning to support DID for identifying and discovering IoT devices and metadata.<br>

However, they are just the first step. In order to ensure a compassionate digital infrastructure that protects digital human rights, we need to design DID-centric architectures that fulfill their decentralized possibilities and minimize the identities and credentials that we share.

	The European Commission’s European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) team warmly welcomes the vote by the W3C to promote the W3C DID Core 1.0 specification to "Recommendation" status.
	<br>
	<br>
	Decentralized identifiers (DID) are a type of identifier that enable verifiable and decentralized digital credentials. Therefore, DID contribute to creating a decentralized verifiable credential ecosystem and building the support services and capabilities that will allow citizens to control their credentials and digital communications in a way that preserves privacy, without requiring permission or monitoring from any other party.
	<br>
	<br>
	The European Commission strives to ensure that European values are at the heart of our digital transition. This includes, in particular, to provide people with control over their online identity and data as well as to enable access to public, private and cross-border digital services.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Commission’s EBSI team looks forward to adopting the W3C DID Core 1.0 specification the EBSI framework as a full W3C standard.&quot;</p>

Restricted items traditionally have been limited within a single transaction, with the age checked using a driver’s license.  Regulatory scrutiny now extends to industry-wide sales of items to individuals no matter where they purchase them, and verifying age for the sale of those items using a driver's license presents a big privacy threat.  Addressing this issue, NACS has created the TruAge program using W3C Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials. Working with our partner Conexxus, NACS has been able to provide a system using open standards that gives a clear “on ramp” for additional participants in the ecosystem.
