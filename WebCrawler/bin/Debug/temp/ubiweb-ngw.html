<h1>Ubiquitous Computing</h1>
<div class="extract">
<p>Ubiquitous computing represents a powerful shift in
computation, where people live, work, and play in a
seamlessly interweaving computing environment.
Ubiquitous computing postulates a world where people
are surrounded by computing devices and a computing
infrastructure that supports us in everything we do.</p>

across a diversity of networked devices
<ul>
<li>Enabling applications to be created using markup, style sheets
and scripts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Context awareness - dynamically adapting to users,
devices and environmental conditions
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Exploiting the features of each device, and not
dropping to the lowest common denominator</li>
<li>Giving users the means to select the modes of interaction
that best meet their needs, subject to the capabilities of the

<li>Application mobility - enabling users to seamlessly switch

<ul>
<li>seamless in the sense of not requiring significant conscious
effort from users</li>
</ul>

<h1>Example: smart meeting</h1>

<p>You are scheduled to meet with colleagues and plan to show a
presentation using your cellphone as a controller and a networked
wall screen as the display device.</p>

<ul class="incremental">
<li>Your slides are on the Web and linked from the agenda</li>
<li>The corporate web server knows such things as:
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Who is expected to attend the meeting and the meeting agenda</li>
<li>A floor plan for your building and what resources are available
in each meeting room</li>
<li>Details of your mobile phone and other personal devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you arrive in the meeting room

<ul class="incremental">
<li>The Bluetooth interface on the wall screen senses whose phones
and notebooks are in the general neighborhood</li>
<li>The meeting application running on the corporate server compares
this to who is expected to attend</li>
<li>Your phone is automatically set up to allow you to present your
slides</li>
<li>The audio and slide transitions are captured by the network for
people who want to review it at a later date</li>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Trust, Security, Privacy and Identity</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Increasingly sensitive information and services will
reside in the network
<ul>
<li>You will be willing to share information with people you trust</li>
<li>This is necessary to fulfil the potential of the Web for rich
applications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trust is bounded and intransitive
<ul>
<li>You trust your bank with your personal finances, but not
with your private life</li>
<li>You trust Mary, and Mary trusts John, but this doesn't
mean you trust John</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information access can be modelled in terms of identity and
group membership
<ul>
<li>Membership of a group entitles access to
information available to that group</li>
<li>Proof of membership is dependent on proving that you have
a given identity (or persona)</li>
<li>Organizations can also be treated as persona</li>

<h1>Trust and devices</h1>

<ul class="incremental">
<li>You are in an airport lounge or a hotel room and
wish to print a company confidential document</li>
<li>Where is the printer, and can it be trusted not
to save a copy or to forward a copy onto someone else?</li>
<li>One idea is to walk up to the printer and give it your
document via a USB thumb drive, or via bluetooth from your phone</li>
<li>You may also be able to ask the printer to prove its identity
and to compare that to the one shown on the airport/hotel's
website
<ul>
<li>A trusted physical communication path between the printer and
your mobile device</li>
<li>Based upon public keys and security certificates signed
by a trusted agency</li>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Access to network based capabilities</h1>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul class="incremental">
<li>Geographic location service
<ul>
<li>Device includes GPS front end and passes this data
to a server where 3rd party service converts this into
the location format needed by the application</li>
<li>This is passed back to the device and exposed as a
DOM Event</li>
<li>The web application doesn't need to know the details
and instead is only concerned about the location format
and frequency of updates</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Speech services
<ul>
<li>An audio extension streams audio to/from the network</li>
<li>This is exposed as a JavaScript object that supports
speech synthesis and recognition through access to remote
speech services</li>
<li>The Web application doesn't need to know the details of
the protocol used to access the remote speech services</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Layered approach to device coordination</h1>

<ul class="incremental">
<li>Descriptions of devices and services
<ul class="incremental">
<li>URI's for describing devices, services and sessions</li>
<li>This enables the use of RDF and the Semantic Web</li>
<li>That makes it easy to combine distributed information sources</li>
<li>Also a role for more informal collective approaches (folksonomies)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discovery and binding
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Relies on access to multiple information sources</li>
<li>To find a nearby printer, first find out where you are,
then find printers in nearby locations</li>
<li>Web applications don't need to know details of discovery
protocols</li>
<li>Discovery can be supported through Web servers and implemented
in terms of existing Web Services standards such as
SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, or simpler use of HTTP (REST)</li>
<li>Restricted role for UPnP (universal plug and play)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Discovery and Home Networks</h1>

<ul class="incremental">
<li>Users of home networks require easy configuration
and diagnosis of problems when faults occur</li>
<li>You purchase a new wireless printer and power it up</li>
<li>How does the printer know which network to attach to?
<ul>
<li>Your neighbor's network may have a stronger signal</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Solution involves telling your printer about your network,
or your network about the printer, or both</li>
<li>This involves the user in some way, but how can we simplify
this?
<ul>
<li>One idea is to use RFID tags</li>
<li>Another is to use your mobile phone as a reader
for 2D bar codes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discovery may involve some human intervention!</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Extending the Web into the Physical World</h1>

<ul class="incremental">
<li>Most people associate the Web with browsing websites
from a desktop computer, or perhaps a smart phone</li>
<li>Web technologies can also be applied to applications
involving devices acting as sensors and effectors</li>
<li>These can be used throughout the home, office, or
factory, etc.</li>
<li>Applications are written with a combination of markup
and scripting with events that are passed between devices</li>
<li>Layered architecture hides details of what communication
protocols are used at the transport layer</li>
<li>Web application has a simple view of the sensor/effector
as a DOM object that you can set properties and event handlers</li>

<h1>W3C Ubiquitous Web Workshop</h1>

<p>Keio University, Tokyo, 9-10 March 2006</p>

<!--
<p>The main objective of this workshop was to help W3C to build
a better understanding of the Ubiquitous Web, and to identify
potential areas for standardization:</p>
-->

<ul>
<li>To explore the vision of the Web as a distributed applications platform that works across a wide range of devices in areas such as offices, home networks, mobile, automotive, aviation, etc. with the potential for increasing the range and reducing the cost of developing and deploying such applications.</li>
<li>To explain how current W3C work fits into this vision, e.g. work on Web Application API's, Delivery Context Interfaces, Device Descriptions, Multimodal Architecture, etc.</li>
<li>To identify and prioritize additional areas which would benefit from standardization, in particular, the integration of sessions and device coordination into web applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="../../2005/10/ubiweb-workshop-cfp.html">Call for
Participation</a> and <a href="../02/ubiwebws-agenda.html">Workshop
Agenda</a> for details including the slide presentations.</p>
